# The Chatroom

A live chatroom built with Vanilla JS and Firebase Firestore. 

Notes about the project: 

1: Anyone can join
2: The chat doesnt save locally
3: Messages are stored in the DB but chat log is lost when logged out or UI is closed.
4: The current presence management functionality doesn't handle idle for too long users. Only way of logging out is clicking log out or firing the beforeunload event on certain browsers.

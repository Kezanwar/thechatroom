# The Chatroom

A live chatroom built with Vanilla JS and Firebase Firestore. 

Making this project from scratch really pushed my development skills, particularly my JS and noSQL Database knowledge. I also found my ability to consume and comprehend developer documentation and turn it into practice improved massively. 

The project highlighted the benefits of using a front end framework such as React, as progressing this vanilla JS web app further than where it is currently would be challenging and unconventional in terms of code architecture.

Another highlight is the benefits of using a back end as a service such as Firebase, a serverless structure is ideal for an application of this size and it turn allowed me to hit the ground running in terms of development.

Notes about the project: Anyone can join, The chat doesnt save locally, messages are stored in the DB but chat log is lost when logged out or UI is closed.
